  WCH CH32 Low-Power Timer (LPTIM) used as a counter/alarm peripheral.

compatible: "wch,ch32-lptim-counter"

include: [base.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  clock-names:
    type: string-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Names of clocks. Should contain "lptim" for the timer bus clock
      and optionally a kernel clock.

  wch_clock_source:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      LPTIM clock source selection:
      0: PCLK1 (APB1 bus clock)
      1: HSI (8MHz internal oscillator)
      2: LSE (32.768kHz external crystal)
      3: LSI (40kHz internal oscillator, default)

  wch_prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Clock prescaler. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
      The effective timer clock is the source clock divided by this value.

  status:
    type: string
    default: "disabled"
    description: |
      Status of the LPTIM device. Set to "okay" to enable.
